Expose shares for r/rw guest access over SMB (Windows Networking) via a Docker
container.

For example usage, see:
* Build: ./build.sh
* Run: ./run.sh

Of course you can run it as you please; just tweak the run.sh script to choose
your workgroup, netbios name and various shares (read-only or otherwise).
